Read in a sequence of 32-bit signed integers (several per line separated by spaces) until a single line
containing zero (0). There will be at most 1000 integers per line. For each line except for the last one,
compute the greatest common divisor (gcd) of that set of integers. Then output on a line the statement
“The gcd of the integers is x.” where x is the desired gcd. Note, for this problem, all answers should
be non-negative.
The input should be taken from keyboard/stdin/System.in.

Sample Input:
2
4 8
15 0 -5
6 20 25 5 30
28 21952 49 294 3822
0

pass gcd_input.txt as stdin to gcd.class when run
